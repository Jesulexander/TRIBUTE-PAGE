    <p>As the first of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes, she was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize,
      the first and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields.
      She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris in 1906.

    Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same that had led to the Dreyfus
    affair—which also fuelled false speculation that Curie was Jewish. During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified
    by the right-wing press as a foreigner and atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the French press' hypocrisy in portraying Curie as an
    unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but portraying her as a French heroine when she received foreign honours such
    as her Nobel Prizes.</p>
